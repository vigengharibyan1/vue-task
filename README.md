# todo-test

Create a simple todo-list application with undo, redo functionality.

## Technical Spec

- Keep your fork and solution in a private repository if possible
- Write tests for your code
- All unit tests must pass
- Create namespaced undo store module, undo module has to be reusable for objects different to todo --> Has to be generic
- Convert Todo store to a namespaced module
- Todo store with ability to add, remove todo tasks and to set the completion state is already provided
- create a subpages where I can see additional details of the todo task e.g /todo/0 will show the detail of the first todo task
- e2e tests are a bonus

## Frontend

As for the frontend a simple list will suffice with checkboxes to toggle the state of the todo tasks, and the ability to remove said tasks from the list.

Inputs to be able to add new Todo are also needed.
